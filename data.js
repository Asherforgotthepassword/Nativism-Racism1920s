        text: "During the 1920s, the United States experienced a strong rise in nativism and racism. After World War I, many Americans feared that immigrants were taking jobs, spreading radical political ideas (like communism), and changing American culture. These fears led to widespread discrimination, violence, and restrictive laws. Racism was also deeply embedded in society. African Americans faced segregation, voter suppression, and racial violence, even as many moved north during the Great Migration hoping for better opportunities. Meanwhile, the Ku Klux Klan gained millions of members and held real political power in several states.",

Immigration laws such as the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 restricted immigration based on race and nationality, favoring Northern and Western Europeans. Southern and Eastern European immigrants, Asian immigrants, African Americans, Catholics, and Jews were heavily impacted by discrimination and exclusion. In contrast, white, native-born Protestant Americans benefited the most from these policies. Despite these changes, racism and nativism were not new in American society. Minority groups, especially African Americans and Asian immigrants, had faced discrimination long before the 1920s. What remained consistent was the belief that some groups were inferior, but during the 1920s these ideas became more openly accepted and enforced by law.",

        text: "Nativism and racism in the 1920s mattered because they set a lasting precedent for using race and ethnicity as criteria in U.S. immigration law. Fear caused by economic instability, post–World War I anxiety, and the Red Scare led many Americans to support discriminatory policies. This era also demonstrated the political power of extremist groups, especially the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), which influenced elections and promoted white supremacy nationwide. The effects of 1920s nativism were long-lasting. Immigration rates dropped sharply for decades due to strict quota laws, while racial hierarchies and segregation were reinforced across the country. These policies and attitudes shaped future debates over civil rights, immigration reform, and who should be allowed to fully belong in American society.",

        text: "By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) lost much of its influence due to scandals, corruption, and declining public support, but many of the policies it supported remained in place. Strict immigration quotas continued for decades and were not fully ended until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which finally removed race-based restrictions. The legacy of 1920s nativism, racism, and xenophobia is still relevant today, as modern debates over immigration, border control, and national identity reflect similar fears and attitudes. This era helps explain why later civil rights movements were necessary to challenge discrimination and expand equality in the United States.",
